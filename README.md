Face Recognition Attendance System
Project Description

The Face Recognition Attendance System is a software that leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to identify individuals and mark their attendance automatically. It is designed to streamline the attendance marking process, making it faster, more accurate, and secure.

Features

Face Recognition: Utilizes deep learning algorithms for accurate face recognition.
Database Integration: Seamlessly integrates with existing database systems to store and manage attendance data.
Real-time Attendance Marking: Marks attendance in real time, providing instant feedback.
Reporting: Allows for easy generation of attendance reports in various formats (CSV, PDF, etc.).
User-Friendly Interface: Offers an intuitive user interface for easy operation.
System Requirements

Hardware
Webcam or any other compatible camera system
PC with at least 8GB of RAM and a quad-core processor
Software
